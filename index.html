            <h2>Programming things I have done</h2>
            <p>I know a good amount of HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and I can do a good amount of frontend web dev. Here are some websites I've worked on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This website</li>
                <li><a href="https://epimteheus.games">Epimetheus Games' website</a> (if that link doesn't work try <a href="https://epimetheusgames.onrender.com">this</a>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://fun-abelgique.github.io">A compilation of some random old JavaScript-related things I've made</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I will probably try to learn Godot and GDScript sometime.</p>
